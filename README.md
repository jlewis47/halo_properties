# halo-properties

Requires Healpy, Numpy, Scipy, Pyplot
Compute halo properties using PHEW/FOF and RAMSES-CUDATON outputs


Setup paths to assoc_outs (Where the star/halo association files go) and to outs (where the final halo property files go) as desired in output_paths.py

python star_halo_latest.py [XXX] [box size] [path to sim] [name for output dir] -- This associates star particles to haloes

python halo_fesc_latest.py [XXX] [box size] [path to sim] [name for output dir] -- This computes gas and dust fesc, magnitude,
magnitude with extinction, SFR, stellar mass, beta, beta with extinction

same as above for halo_dust_latest.py

[XXX] should be replaced with the last 3 numbers of the target RAMSES output folder


reading an output can be accomplished using the read_outs(outnb,tag,path) function in functions_latest.py

outnb (str) is the last 3 digits of the RAMSES output number
tag (str) is 'fesc_dust' by default (this is changed in the final lines of halo_fesc_latest.py, and cna be used to write several binary output files if the need arises eg : when different versions of the same computation). For reading halo_dust_latest.py outputs, tag should be gas_'dust'
path (str) is the path to the files generated by halo_fesc_latest.py If they haven't been moved, this should correspond to the folder named [name for output dir] in the folder targeted by the outs vars in star_halo_latest.py and in halo_fesc_latest.py
